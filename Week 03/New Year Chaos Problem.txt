// Well i copied this code
// You have given an output array of sequence and you have to identify if they bribed more than 2 people or not.
// We have to find the selected value in i first if !present move towards i-1 and i-2 otherwise return "Too Chaotic" because of more than 2 bribes and stop the loop.
when we moving towards backward increment the bribe count and return the sum of all the bribes.
